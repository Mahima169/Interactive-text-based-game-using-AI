I’ve faced your challenges, and I’ve won.\n I’m not leaving this castle until you’re defeated.”\n\n Aldric laughs, a cold, cruel sound. “Brave words, child. But let’s see how you fare against my army.”\n\n With a wave of his hand, Aldric unleashes his constructs. They charge at you, their eyes glowing with malice.\n\n You can choose to fight against Aldric using your magical artifacts or you can turn back.",

The wizard’s smile fades, replaced by a look of anger.\n “You think you can defeat me?” he snarls. “I am Aldric the Arcane! My power is unmatched!”\n\n You take a deep breath, focusing all your energy. You hold up the sword, its blade glowing with the combined power of all the artifacts you’ve collected.\n “This ends now,” you say.\n\n Aldric raises his hands, summoning a massive storm of dark magic, but you are faster. You charge at the wizard, the sword blazing with light.\n As both your powers clash, the castle trembles, and the air fills up with the sound of shattering stone and roaring magic.\n\n With a final, mighty swing, you strike Aldric down. The wizard’s magic falters, and he lets out a cry of rage as he is consumed by the light of the sword.",
