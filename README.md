2LevelsCapstone is the file where I have trained the two gpt2 models.
The other CapstoneBackend file is the backend for the react app. I suggest you run this on colab and copy the ngrok url, paste it in the App.js file of 
src of frontend and do npm start in the frontend directory.
Before running the backend, upload the story.json to colab
